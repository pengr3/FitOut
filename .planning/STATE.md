# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-03)

**Core value:** Find & book a space — search → real availability → reserve a time slot → pay, with confidence the booking is real.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — listings-&-host-onboarding (Phase 01 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (Listings & Host Onboarding) — not started
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 01 (auth-accounts) COMPLETE & verified — single account with booker+host capabilities, sessions, password reset, profile + avatar; 54/54 tests, build green; code review 2 blockers + 5 warnings fixed; 3 human-UAT items pending (Google OAuth, Cloudinary, reset-email delivery — all credential-dependent, tracked in 01-HUMAN-UAT.md). Next: Phase 02 (listings + Stripe Connect onboarding).
Last activity: 2026-06-03

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase dependency-driven order — identity → supply → availability + double-booking guarantee → booking core + search (no payment) → payments → full instant/request integration → bookings management + cancellation → group bookings. Ordering is non-negotiable for correctness.
- [Roadmap]: Double-booking prevented at the DB level (Postgres GiST exclusion constraint on tstzrange, scoped by listing) — must exist before any booking insert (Phase 3).
- [Roadmap]: Stripe Connect bookability gate built in Phase 2 (gate listing bookability, not creation, on payouts_enabled) so it can never be bypassed later.
- [Phase ?]: [01-01]: Postgres image is postgis/postgis:18-3.6 with volume at /var/lib/postgresql (PG18+ convention); bare :18 tag is not on Docker Hub
- [Phase ?]: [01-01]: Integration tests isolate to a dedicated 'test' Postgres schema and migrate ./drizzle before assertions; shared Resend/Cloudinary/Google mocks in tests/helpers/mocks.ts
- [Phase ?]: [01-01]: jose NOT a direct dep (Apple OAuth deferred); src/lib/db/schema.ts is a placeholder owned by the Better Auth CLI until Plan 02
- [Phase 01]: [01-02]: Better Auth configured per D-01..D-13 — email/pw soft gate + Google OAuth, 30d sliding Postgres sessions, revokeSessionsOnPasswordReset:true, input:false canBook/canHost/role escalation guard, profile additionalFields; schema generated + migration APPLIED to live DB
- [Phase 01]: [01-02]: Kept built-in name/email/image + added explicit firstName/lastName/avatarUrl/avatarPublicId (D-09/D-10 public-private split); all timestamps timestamptz; rateLimit.enabled:true with tuned customRules
- [Phase 01]: [01-02]: Fixed Plan-01 test-DB isolation bug (integration writes leaked into dev public schema) — now per-Vitest-worker isolated schema with public-ref rewriting; mocked-email capture needs a fake RESEND_API_KEY in setup
- [Phase 01]: [01-03]: Capability at signup is set via a privileged db.update on the user row AFTER auth.api.signUpEmail (canBook/canHost are input:false — never in the signup body); intent maps to exactly one flag (D-02/T-03-01). book→canBook→"/", host→canHost→"/host" (D-05, /host built later)
- [Phase 01]: [01-03]: Logged-out forms pattern — client component RHF + zodResolver(sharedSchema) for UX, SAME schema re-validates in the server action / Better Auth re-checks server-side; forgot-password is enumeration-safe (uniform message), login error is generic
- [Phase 01]: [01-03]: Patched a BROKEN transitive dep (@better-auth/kysely-adapter vs kysely@0.29 missing exports) that 500'd every route + broke next build — scripts/patch-kysely-adapter.mjs (postinstall), patches dead sqlite-dialect code only. Also: src/middleware.ts kept despite Next 16 'proxy' deprecation (works as required)
- [Phase 01]: [01-04]: Public/private profile split enforced by an ALLOW-LIST projection (src/lib/profile.ts publicProfile → only avatarUrl/firstName/bio/city/createdAt) so a new private column can never silently leak (D-09/D-10); member-since rendered locale-aware (Pitfall 5)
- [Phase 01]: [01-04]: Activate-later capability (activateHosting/activateBooking) flips canHost/canBook via a privileged db.update after a session check — same input:false mechanism as signup; both capabilities COEXIST (neither clears the other, D-03). No Stripe here (Phase 2, D-05)
- [Phase 01]: [01-04]: Logged-in surfaces gate per-page in the route-group LAYOUT via auth.api.getSession() — (app) booker shell + (host) dashboard; (host) layout is the REAL canHost gate (redirect !canHost→/), middleware stays optimistic-only. /host seam from Plan 03 now filled
- [Phase 01]: [01-04]: Avatar upload re-validates image/* + ≤5MB with a Zod File schema in the server action before the server-only Cloudinary call; stores avatarUrl + avatarPublicId. Real Cloudinary upload is a manual check once CLOUDINARY_* env vars are set (proven via mock)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

Open product decisions to resolve before their relevant phase begins (from research):

- Phase 3: Slot granularity (30- vs 60-min minimum booking unit).
- Phase 6: Request-to-book expiry SLA (must be shorter than Stripe's ~7-day authorization hold limit).
- Phase 7: Cancellation/refund policy matrix (who × time-to-start × % refunded × commission × payout) — blocks the cancel flow.
- Phase 8: Whether invited attendees need an account to RSVP (v1 default: tokenized link, no account); group capacity source (listing capacity vs per-booking limit).
- Phase 2 / Phase 5: Cold-start liquidity — consider lightweight admin/seed tooling and a zero-result-search metric; do not over-build.
- Before Phase 2 wires Stripe payouts to canHost: close deferred Phase-1 security items WR-06 (add rate-limit + audit trail on capability-activate server actions) and WR-04 (email-send retry/observability). Tracked in 01-REVIEW.md (deferred) + 01-SECURITY.md audit notes.
